Upsales-Freshdesk Integration
This Node.js application automatically syncs customer data from Upsales to Freshdesk. It periodically fetches customer information from Upsales and either creates new contacts or updates existing ones in Freshdesk.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/upsales-freshdesk-integration.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
 
cd upsales-freshdesk-integration
Install Dependencies Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash

npm install
Configuration
You need to configure your Freshdesk and Upsales API keys before running the application. Open the index.js file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and domain:

javascript

// Freshdesk Configuration
const FRESHDESK_API_KEY = 'your_freshdesk_api_key';
const FRESHDESK_DOMAIN = 'your_freshdesk_domain';

// Upsales Configuration
const UPSALES_API_KEY = 'your_upsales_api_key';
Usage
To start the application and begin syncing customers, run:

bash
Kopiera kod
npm start
How It Works
Fetching Customers from Upsales:

The script sends a GET request to the Upsales API to retrieve customer data.
Syncing with Freshdesk:

For each customer fetched from Upsales, the script checks if the customer already exists in Freshdesk.
If the customer does not exist, a new contact is created in Freshdesk.
If the customer exists, the script updates the contact's details in Freshdesk.
Polling:

The application polls the Upsales API every hour to check for new or updated customers.
Polling is controlled by the startPolling function, which repeats the sync process every 3,600,000 milliseconds (1 hour).
Stopping the Polling Process
If you need to stop the polling process manually, you can call the stopPollingNow() function. This will set the stopPolling flag to true, stopping the next polling cycle:

javascript
Kopiera kod
function stopPollingNow() {
  stopPolling = true;
}
